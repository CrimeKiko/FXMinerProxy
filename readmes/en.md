# # : sparkles: features



* : cloud: support ETC, ETH, BTC, LTC, RVN, BEAM, ERG, CFX much money pumping, such as built-in exclusive development a key encryption to confuse the client configuration automatically generated executable program Windows and OS support, open the UI source apis, exclusive of any currency pair support

* : ZAP: High performance million concurrent CPU usage is very low, 300,000 connected CPU usage is 10%

* ðŸ’» Customized author pumping mode (range 0.1-0.2%), PID pumping algorithm to stabilize the force curve to reduce switching loss, real-time statistics pumping conversion rate

* ðŸ“š Original pumping algorithm for E pool optimization E pool pumping effect is the best, no mining machine offline bug curve is perfect, several points higher than other software

* ðŸ’¾ security and stability, original AES confound encryption, simulation of iot traffic security and stability, background one-key configuration automatically generated Windows and Linux version, traditional TLS/SSL TCP also supports, CC attack defense

* : Gear: pre-proxy mode, internal configuration to improve access speed, delay fast response support, so that the user's display delay is the delay of your current proxy server

* : Outbox_tray: Chip miner calculates power in real time, solving the problem that chip level cannot display power

* :card_file_box: indicates hot configuration modification. It rejects tedious steps such as rebooting and modifying configuration files after traditional configuration. One-click configuration file import and export is supported

* : ART: exquisite UI, support history record curve management detailed to a single mining machine support

* :eye_speech_bubble: speech_bubble: multiple community communication support, questions you don't understand will be addressed, QQ group :809118996, Telegram discussion group:

* : Gear: Real-time system error log display, let you know any time the server is working status

* :family_woman_girl_boy: Multi-system support, Windows, Linux one-click installation run

* ðŸ’» Linux SSH2 teamwork mode software built-in server remote login one-click management of your server



## :hammer_and_wrench: deployment
### Linux one-click Management scripts (root permission required)
* å¦‚æžœæ²¡æœ‰curlå‘½ä»¤è¯·è¾“å…¥ apt-get install curl installation
```shell
  bash <(curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FxPool/FxMinerProxyV3/main/install_zh.sh)
```
### Windows directly download and decompress run run.exe
* Run run.exe (to ensure the program never crashes)
```shell
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FxPool/FxMinerProxyV3/main/fxminerproxyv3windows.zip
```  
## :alembic: Development Fee
* Fixed 0.27%
